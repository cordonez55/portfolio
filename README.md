# Cassandra Ordonez - Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio project created during the Full Stack Web Development program. It shows the work I've done in school, including projects, skills, resources and my developer setup.

## About the Site

I used React to build this site, and Docker to run it like a real deployed app on my computer.

## How to Run it with Docker

### 1. Install Docker
Make sure Docker and Docker Desktop are installed.

### 2. Run the App
Open your terminal in this folder and type:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
